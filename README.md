# 3-Band-Active-Audio-Equalizer-Mixer
This project involves the design, simulation, and hardware implementation of a 3-band active graphic equalizer. The system processes an audio signal by splitting it into three frequency bands (100Hz, 1kHz, and 4kHz), allowing for frequency-specific amplification/filtering, and recombining them through a summing amplifier stage.
